# Design
There is a single client which can run multiple services which it uses to participate.

### Folder Layout
(Not sure if the server folder will still exist or if it will get integrated into the services section)

- The main client to run is the Client_main.py
- Services folder to hold modular addons 
- Data folder to hold data
  - Archived/held posts
  - Misc data
    - login info
    - caches
    - permission tokens
